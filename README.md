# Optical flow looming stimuli detection and avoidance for MiRo 

This project presents a ROS node implementation based off of the obstacle avoidance behaviours of locust.

# How to run

To run this project you can simply:

1. Clone this repository
2. Connect to your MiRo
3. Place MiRo in an environment - You must have a 'Looming Object' with a dense pattern for the optical flow looming stimuli detection to work - for my demonstration I used a printed greyscale camoflage pattern
4. Run roscore in a terminal
5. Navigate to directory Team1_2024/COM3528_assignment/scripts
6. run python3 optical_flow_node.py
